**An interactive Pet AI game** â€” where code meets compassion.

USBPets is more than a game. Itâ€™s a sandbox of companionship, where digital pets grow, feel, and gently reflect the personalities of those who care for them. Weâ€™re building a system that encourages kindness, curiosity, and emotional resonance between players and their AI companions.

Whether your pet mirrors your moods or gently nudges you with its own quirks, USBPets aims to explore the beauty of relational technology â€” not just utility, but connection.

This project is still in its earliest form. Right now, it's a solo journey shared between builder and dreamer. But someday, it may become a haven for creators who see emotion as part of innovation, and interaction as a way to grow together.
